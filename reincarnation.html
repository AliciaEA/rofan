                <p class="subtitle">Yes, I did a whole page just to talk about this genre because I think it is
                    necesarry

            <h2>Reincarnation Cliche</h2>
            <p>As many of the other genres, reincarnation has its own cliches. We have for example, the <span
                    id="cliche"> 'Oh I read a novel and died, and now I reincarnated and have to save my life'</span>
            </p>

            <p>But let me explain, reincarnation is not the same as transmigration. When we talk about reincarnation, is
                the fact that the female lead was born there, but has the memories of her past life. However,
                Transmigration is possesing someone else's body, like stealing his mind and body and now it is yours.
            </p>

            <p>Reincarnation per se, is a cliche. And obviously, the cliche depends on the other genres of the novel or
                manhwa. But the one that I'm talking about is Romance + Reincarnation</p>

            <h2>But why...?</h2>
            <p>Yeah, let me ask myself why do i keep reading all of this cliches if i know how it is going to end. Well,
                I dont know. Maybe is because of the emotion. Or because the male lead is handsome. Who knows?</p>
