                <h2>What is Rofan?</h2>
                <p>Rofan, is basically the combination of two genres: Romance and Fantasy. The term comes mainly form
                    korean
                    web novels, so when I say Rofan, I'm talking about korean web novels, manhwa, manhua, webtoons,
                    movies,
                    etc. Everything. But in most of the times, those.</p>

                    <h3>Historical</h3>
                    <p>Historical Manhwas and webnovels are the best. Specially on the monarchy time, since there is
                        more
                        drama</p>

                    <h3>Transmigration</h3>
                    <p>These are where the protagonist transmigrates to a novel, in most of the times one that they have
                        read before</p>

                    <h3>Villainess</h3>
                    <p>The one where (in most of the cases, the female lead) was the villain, and now has to survive in
                        a
                        world where everyone thinks she is one</p>
