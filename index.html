            <h2>What is Rofan?</h2>
            <p>Rofan, is basically the combination of two genres: Romance and Fantasy. The term comes mainly form korean web novels, so when I say Rofan, I'm talking about korean web novels, manhwa, manhua, webtoons, movies, etc. Everything. But in most of the times, those.</p>
